# Simulation_Engine_OpenGL_C++
Currently not for deployment, but you can use it in windows (have the Mingw setup). <br/>
Directly run the executable - bin\main  <br/>
There are multiple example codes in assets\codeSample. </br> </br>


Showcase of some of those examples I have worked upon : </br> </br>
