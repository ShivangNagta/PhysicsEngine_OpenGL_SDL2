# Simulation_Engine_OpenGL_C++

Currently no proper cross platform support, but you can use it in windows (have the Mingw setup). <br/>

I mostly use it as a template for my projects. I have included the GUI library(ImGUI), which I use if needed. </br>

There are a lot of sample project codes, I have worked upon in assets\codeSample. But you will have to </br> 

Directly run the executable - bin\main  <br/>
or if you want to compile yourself then I have added the makefile, so you can run the "make" command.(Properly setup the makefile to compile the correct files)</br></br>


Showcase of some of those examples I have worked upon : </br> </br>
